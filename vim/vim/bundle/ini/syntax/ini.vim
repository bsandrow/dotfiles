" First, copy this file to ~/.vim/syntax/ini.vim. (You will need to create
" that directory, if you haven't already.)
"
" Then, to make vim automatically use that syntax definition for .ini and hgrc
" files, you'll need to add this to your ~/.vim/filetype.vim file (which you
" will need to create, if you haven't already):
"
" au BufNewFile,BufRead *.ini,*/.hgrc,*/.hg/hgrc setf ini
"
" What this means is:
" 	Upon creating or reading any file
" 		whose name ends in .ini,
" 		or whose name is .hgrc,
" 		or whose name is hgrc and is in a .hg directory,
" 	set the file type to "ini".
"
" When you set (or the auto-command sets) the file type, vim will load the
" syntax definition.
"
