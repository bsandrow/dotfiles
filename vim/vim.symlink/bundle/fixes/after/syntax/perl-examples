### Perl Folding Failure Examples

#
# Examples of Perl that break the stock folding setup in Vim 7.2 and 7.3 (possibly other versions
# too)
#
sub function()
{
    # There should be no fold here
    sub { }

    # There should be a fold here
    sub {
    }

    # There should be another fold here.
    sub test() {
    }

    # This sub should fold correctly rather than terminate at the closing } for the outer function
    function(
        sub {
        },
    );
}

# This should fold correctly
sub function() {{
}}

# This should fold correctly
sub function() {(
)}

# This should fold correctly
sub function() {
}
