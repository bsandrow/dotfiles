# zsh-legacy - a helper for zsh in legacy environments
#
# A script to help out in environments where switching back and forth between
# new and old versions of zsh happens. Some older versions of zsh will blow up
# when the encounter a file compiled on a newer version of zsh.
#
# Some examples of where this might be useful:
#     1. Testing a config on newer and older versions as the same user
#     2. A single home directory setup (e.g. NFS mount) where the systems
#        have different versions of zsh installed.
