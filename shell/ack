# Debian/Ubuntu package ack as 'ack-grep' (since there is another package named
# ack), so let's alias ack => ack-grep, but only if the ack in $PATH isn't
# already a version of ack (e.g. we don't have one installed in ~/bin or via
# perlbrew). The alternative is to create a shell function that performs this
# every time we run 'ack'.
